Update: November 30th, 2004
---------------------------------------------------
 Quite a bit of changes. So many that I didn't even bother
noting them so I forgot what they were. I do remember changing
the tile editor to use one form and to support GBA and a few
other formats. I also added support for 16-Bit ASCII direct
input as well as 16-Bit ASCII and KANA searching! Just use
it damn it and stop complaining! If you don't like it,
then you can swallow an egg and get it stuck in your throat.
I'm just kidding! Anyway, Have fun!!!
